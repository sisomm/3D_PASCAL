# 3D_PASCAL
Some 3D experiments I did with Pascal in 1992. Basically, a shot at doing 3D graphics using vector math

the code was adapted in 2019 to use dosbox. Also it works with turbo pascal 7. A display driver is included for convenience (EGAVGA.BGI)

The main programs are in DAK.PAS and MANY.PAS
